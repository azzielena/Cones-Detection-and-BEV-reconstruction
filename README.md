# 📌 Cones Detection and BEV Reconstruction

## 📖 Project Description
In our project we focused on the creation of a neural network with the aim of reconstructing the roadway starting from the position of the blue and yellow cones in world coordinates that delimit its boundaries.

### 📂 Initial Input
Files containing (x, y) coordinates of yellow and blue cones collected from specific frames.

### 🛣️ Goal
Reconstruction of roadway boundaries and the centerline.

## 🔄 Project Development Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Dataset Preprocessing
✔️ Feature selection to remove unclear or erroneous frames and apply transformations to standardize the data.

✔️ Data augmentation to enrich the dataset and enhance the model's robustness.

✔️ Conversion into a grid format to serve as input for the neural network.

### 2️⃣ Neural Network Model Development
🧠 Various neural network models were developed and tested to identify the most suitable architecture for solving the problem.

### 3️⃣ Performance Evaluation and Results Visualization
📈 Evaluating the model's effectiveness in reconstructing the road and accurately localizing the cones.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Here’s how to navigate through the repository:

- **`data_preprocessing`** ➝ Contains input datasets with cone coordinates.
  - `sequenze/` ➝ Contains input datasets with cone coordinates.
  - `create_initial_dataset.py` ➝ Extracts the most relevant inputs by removing invalid ones.
  - `create_centered_dataset.py` ➝ standardizes the inputs, aligning all roadways to start from position (0,0).
- **`data_augmentation/`** ➝ Includes files that apply rotation and flipping along the x-axis to increase the number of available inputs.
- **`supporting_dataset/`** ➝ Contains the intermediate datasets generated by the preprocessing and data augmentation phase
- **`data_CSV/`** ➝
